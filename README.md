# Bike-Sales-Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer demographics and purchasing behavior to understand what factors influence bike purchases. The goal is to help business stakeholders identify high-potential customer segments and optimize marketing and sales strategies.
An interactive Excel dashboard was built using cleaned customer data, pivot tables, and visualizations to deliver actionable insights for decision-makers.

## Business Problem
A bike retail company wants to increase bike sales by understanding:
* Which customer segments are more likely to purchase a bike.
* How income, region, gender, and commute distance impact buying decisions
* Where to focus targeted marketing campaigns
Raw customer data existed, but no consolidated analytical view was available for leadership to make data-driven decisions.

## Solution
I built an end-to-end Excel analytics solution that:
* Cleans and structures raw customer data
* Creates pivot tables for multi-dimensional analysis
* Builds an interactive dashboard to visualize key trends
* Extracts business insights to support strategic decisions
This enables stakeholders to quickly explore customer behavior without writing queries.

## Key Insights
* 48% of customers purchased a bike
* Buyers have higher average income ($57.4K vs $55.0K)
* Pacific region shows highest purchase rate (58.9%)
* Purchase behavior is gender-neutral
* Short-to-medium commute customers show higher buying tendency

## Business Impact
* Identified high-value customer segments
* Highlighted top-performing region for focused marketing
* Enabled data-driven sales and campaign planning

## Business Recommendations
* Focus marketing spend in the Pacific region
* Target mid-to-high income urban customers
* Promote bikes as commute alternatives
* Use personalized campaigns rather than gender-based targeting

## Project Outcome
The project transforms raw customer data into a decision-ready analytics dashboard, enabling leadership to:
* Identify profitable customer segments
* Optimize regional marketing strategy
* Support data-driven product positioning
